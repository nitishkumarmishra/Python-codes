# Python-codes
This is the collection of Python codes for differential expression analysis.
I developed these code for using DESeq2, edgeR and limma in Python JupyterLan Notebook by using rpy2 package.
I developed these codes based on small example files. These codes are working well, in future I will use these code for my data analysis.
These codes help me to use power of Python and R in same Notebook. 
In past I also used Python and R in R markdown by using reticulate. I found rpy2 based Python and R integration is better and easy.
