# Python-codes
This is the collection of Python codes for differential expression analysis. I also make code or heatmap plot for Dr. Davis project.
DESeq2, limma and edgeR are the most popular tools for differential expression analysis. There is no any other alternate packages in Python. So I developed these codes to use power of DESeq2, limma and edgeR in Python. I developed these code for using DESeq2, edgeR and limma in Python JupyterLan Notebook by using rpy2 package. These codes help me to harness power of Python and R in single Notebook. 

I developed these codes and tested on small example files, and working well. Its very similar to R codes, in future I will use these code for my data analysis.

In past I also used Python and R in R markdown by using reticulate. I found rpy2 based Python and R integration is better and easy. I also developed Python codes for survival analysis. I will use these codes for my future projects. It's just prototype of codes, I have to work more on GSEA and other parts.

I also make python code (prototype) for the GSEA analysis and GSEA, volcano and heatmap plots
